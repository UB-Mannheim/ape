Summary
-------

Every email ALMA sends can be printed by a custom printer within your
local network. "Request Letters", "Resource Slips", "Reminders" or other emails
that are received by the server are directly forwarded to the APE script.

The APE script parses incoming HTML emails and converts them to PDF. The
generated PDF file can be printed out on any user-defined printer.

APE mainly supports two functions:

 * direct print (prints email immediately)
 * queue-controlled print (prints collected emails by cronjob)

APE has a simple and directory based file structure. Configuration changes can
easily be made by editing text files.

Additionally APE offers functions like caching emails in a temp directory.
It even has a print history, logging mechanisms and a print preview
for the best possible transparency.


Hard & Software requirements
----------------------------

APE was built on a Debian server system, but can be installed on any other
Windows or Linux system that is able to run an SMTP and web server as well.

The description beneath covers the software requirements of a Linux based
environment:

 * SMTP active and running
 * Apache2 or similar
 * PHP 7.4 or 8.0
 * PHP Mime Mail Parser
 * CUPS
 * WeasyPrint


Installation
------------

Mannheim University Library develops and installs APE as a web application
on a Linux server running Debian GNU Linux (Bullseye). Other hardware and software
combinations can also be used, but might require some smaller modifications.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed information.
